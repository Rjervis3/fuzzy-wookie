# Commentary on Loops Lab

-> examine 3-loops program
-uses 3 different kind of loops, for, while, do.. while

-> Print a table

int i;
for(i=1; i<13; i++)
printf("%4d%16.4lf\n", quarts, liters);

i=1;
while(i<13)
printf("%4d%16.4lf\n", quarts, liters); 

-> simple loops with the scribbler

-> rising pitch example

-> Think about nested loops and when to use them.


-> What is blocking vs non-blocking in regards to the scribbler?
- blocking calls cannot execute other commands simultaniously

-> Make scribbler move in a spiral

-> Motion with obstacles
- forward until obstable
- turns right at obstabcle and moves forward
- infinitly loop

// needs testing and programs filled in
