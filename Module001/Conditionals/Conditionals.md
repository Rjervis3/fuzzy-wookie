# Conditionals Lab Commentary

This lab uses the Scribbler 2 robots and still requires testing.

-> Using the light and obstacle sensors
- see light-sensor-example.c
- see obstacle-sensor-example.c

-> Switch Statements

-> Break Statements break out of the conditions in a switch statment
	so that only one statement runs.

-> Consider when we want to recieve data from the robots; Do we want to 
	make multiple calls, or just get one reading?

-> Combine two tests with && and ||

-> Switch to avoid objects
