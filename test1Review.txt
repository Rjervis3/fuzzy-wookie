1. Write Program a robot to beep once at 50Hz, twice at 100Hz, etc until 
   it beeps 8 times at 400Hz.
   -> Modify to accept an array.
2. Write a funtion with the following signature:
  void function (int a, int * b), that modifies a and b and contains
  a print statement. What would the corresponding print statement in main look
  like? What would each print? Draw a schematic memory diagram.

3.Write a program that moves the robot forward until it sees an object, 
 then turns, then moves forward again until it sees an object.

4.What does the following print:
            int a = 5
            double b = 4
            int c = 4
            double d = a/b
            double e = a/c
and so on so forth.
5.Convert 11, 15, and 12 to binary.
6. Write out some declarations and initializations:
- Declare a variable that is a pointer to a variable (no assignment)
- Declare a pointer assign it a value.
- Do the above step on 2 separate lines
- Declare 2 pointers, assign the first a value, and make the second point
  to the first.
7. What is -11 in sign-magnitude notation
   -in ones complement?
   -in twos complement?


* Bonus * *Mostly for fun, but also good review *

- What is a union? How is it declared? How do you access its members?
- What does i << 1 do if i is some number in binary?
- Write a function that takes two integers and another function as
  its parameters.
